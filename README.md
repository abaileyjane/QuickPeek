# Quick Peek - a capstone project for the Thinkful program, focusing on making API calls and using the responses in a new and interesting way.
##Introduction  The goal of QuickPeek is to reduce the time spent searching for relevant news. It eliminates visiting multiple sites and completing multiple searches to reach the coverage you're looking for. Quick peek is a news comparison site that allows users to compare coverage of a current event from the NY times and the Guardian, side by side on one platform. The user enters a search on the main home screen and is then taken to the results page. There they will find up to 10 articles from the NY Times and 10 articles from the Guardian. The search result page also includes the top 10 most relevant images at the top of the screen, as often pictures can say more than words.   The user can click the links on the search result page to be taken to the full article on the host site. One search, endless coverage.
